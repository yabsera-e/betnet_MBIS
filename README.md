## Project Description

BetNet is a web application developed as a **Digital Business and Technology course project** at Addis Ababa University. It simulates an e-commerce platform aimed at **connecting rent seekers with house owners**. The platform allows house owners to list their properties, and rent seekers to browse, filter, and contact them securely. Payments are simulated for contacting house owners, demonstrating digital business workflows and secure communication.

The project is implemented using **Django** as the backend framework with **SQLite** as the database for quick setup and development.

### Challenges in the Rental Market

- **Information Gaps:** Rent seekers often lack reliable property details.  
- **Time Inefficiency:** Physical visits and multiple inquiries slow down the process.  
- **Trust Issues:** House owners cannot easily verify serious inquiries.  
- **Payment Uncertainty:** Secure and verifiable transactions are difficult.  

### BetNet Solution

BetNet addresses these challenges by providing:

1. **Property Listing Creation:** House owners can post detailed listings, including photos, rent, location, and amenities. A **listing fee** ensures commitment.  
2. **Search and Filtering:** Rent seekers can filter properties based on price, location, bedrooms, and more.  
3. **Payment Simulation:** Rent seekers complete a small payment simulation to access the house owner contact info.  
4. **Messaging System:** Verified users communicate securely with house owners.  
5. **Trust and Transparency:** The platform demonstrates digital business workflows while enhancing trust between users.  

## Key Features

1. **User Registration and Authentication:** Secure login for house owners and rent seekers.  
2. **Property Listing Creation:** House owners post detailed rental properties.  
3. **Search and Filtering:** Renters refine searches based on preferences.
